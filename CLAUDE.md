# pae-backend-ot

Owns: polling Modbus TCP devices (SEL RTACs) on a schedule and storing their
register/point readings as time-series in TimescaleDB, plus the sites → devices →
device-points CRUD, live register streaming, and CSV export API (all under `/api`).
Does NOT own: the upstream Modbus aggregator/RTAC itself (external, `AGGREGATOR_MODBUS_HOST`),
the DAS data-acquisition API (`pae-das-api`), or any downstream dashboard/analytics.

## This repo diverges from the standard Python setup — read this
- No uv. Deps install via `pip install -e .` (Docker) against pyproject; there is no
  `requirements.txt` and no `setup.py`. Types are checked with **mypy, not pyright**;
  formatting is **black + ruff** (line-length 100). `uv run` / pyright do not apply here.
- Imports are flat and require `PYTHONPATH=src` — modules import as `from config import ...`,
  `from db.connection import ...`, NOT a package. Bare `pytest` and bare `python main.py` fail.
- There is no auth layer at all yet; every endpoint is unauthenticated. `/api/healthz`
  must stay that way — the Docker HEALTHCHECK and k8s probes hit it.

## Commands (need Docker running first)
- Setup / dev: `make up-build` (Windows: `.\make.ps1 up-build`) — builds & starts
  postgres, redis, app; migrations auto-run in the container entrypoint.
- Run outside Docker: `make run` (= `cd src && python -m main`, needs pg+redis reachable).
- Unit tests: `make test-unit` (Windows: `.\make.ps1 test-unit`) — runs pytest in a
  `python:3.11-slim` container with `.[dev]` installed; no local Python or containers needed.
  Narrow it with `make test-unit TEST_PATH=tests/unit/helpers/modbus` /
  `.\make.ps1 test-unit tests/unit/helpers/modbus/test_modbus_data_mapping.py`.
- Integration tests: `make test-integration` / `.\make.ps1 test-integration [path]` — spins
  up a throwaway postgres + redis (`docker-compose.test.yaml`, project `pae-backend-ot-test`,
  tmpfs, no host ports), migrates, runs `tests/integration`, tears it down. Never touches the
  dev stack; `make up` is not needed.
- All tests: `make test` / `.\make.ps1 test` = `test-unit` then `test-integration`.
- Lint/format: `make lint` (ruff + mypy) / `make format` (black + ruff).
- Migrate manually: `make migrate` (= `python scripts/migrate_db.py`).

## The feature comes first; tests prove it
The feature is the priority. Build it to the highest standard first — correct behavior,
correct HTTP status codes and error types, clean layering, the conventions in this file —
and *then* write unit and integration tests that prove it works as intended.
- Tests describe the behavior the feature **should** have. Never shape a test (or an
  assertion) around what the code happens to do today.
- If a test exposes a defect, fix the feature — don't weaken the test to pass. A strict
  `xfail` is only for a defect that is genuinely out of scope for the current change, and
  must be called out to the user.
- A green suite over a sub-standard feature is not done. Passing tests are the proof, not
  the goal.

## Unit tests are required for every feature and bug fix
Every new feature, behavior change, or bug fix ships with unit tests **in the same change**.
A change is not done until `make test-unit` / `.\make.ps1 test-unit` passes and ruff is clean.
- **Layout mirrors `src/`:** tests for `src/<path>/<module>.py` live in
  `tests/unit/<path>/test_<module>.py` — e.g. `src/helpers/modbus/poll_device.py` →
  `tests/unit/helpers/modbus/test_poll_device.py`. Create missing folders as needed.
- **Every test folder needs an `__init__.py`.** Without it pytest puts `tests/unit/` on
  `sys.path` and `tests/unit/helpers/` shadows `src/helpers/`.
- **Shared test data** lives in plain modules under `tests/unit/` (e.g.
  `tests/unit/data_type_fixtures.py`), imported as `from unit.data_type_fixtures import ...`.
- **No I/O in unit tests** — no DB, redis, network, or real clock. Pass fakes in or patch at
  the boundary. Anything that needs postgres/redis belongs in `tests/integration/`.
- **Bug fixes include a regression test** that fails without the fix.
- Cover the invariant, not just the happy path: rejected inputs, edge cases, and the
  "these two lists must not drift apart" checks (see `tests/unit/helpers/modbus/`).
- Group tests in `Test*` classes per behavior, with a module docstring saying what
  invariant the file guards. Test code follows the same ruff rules as `src/`.

## Integration tests are required for API changes
Any new or changed endpoint (`src/api/routers/`) ships with integration tests in
`tests/integration/api/routers/test_<router>.py` **in the same change**, and a change touching
the API isn't done until `make test-integration` passes too. See `tests/integration/README.md`.
- **Same layout rules as unit tests:** mirror `src/`, `__init__.py` in every folder, shared
  helpers in plain modules imported as `from integration.factories import ...`.
- **Use the fixtures in `tests/integration/conftest.py`:** `client` (httpx AsyncClient on
  a fresh app; lifespan/scheduler not run) and `db` (raw asyncpg connection). The autouse
  `reset_state` truncates all tables + flushes redis before each test, so tests are
  independent. Never add a test that depends on another test's data.
- **Arrange through the API** (`factories.create_site/create_device/upsert_points`). Use raw
  SQL via `db` only for what the API can't create (e.g. `factories.insert_reading`).
- **Assert status codes and response bodies**, and cover the error paths (404/409/400/422),
  not just the happy path.
- **Found a bug while writing a test?** Fix the feature (see "The feature comes first").
  Only if the fix is out of scope: assert the *correct* behavior, mark it
  `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason="BUG: ...")`, and tell the user. Never weaken the
  assertion to match the bug. Remove the marker in the change that fixes it (strict XPASS
  fails the run).
- **Safety guard:** tests only run when `INTEGRATION_DB_RESET_ALLOWED=1` (set by
  `docker-compose.test.yaml` and CI); otherwise they skip. Never set it against a real DB.
- **Anything needing Modbus** (polling, live stream, `/health_modbus_client`) waits for the
  mock Modbus server, which will be added as a service in `docker-compose.test.yaml`.

## Linting is CI-enforced — every change must leave `ruff check` clean
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `ruff check src/ tests/` and **fails the build on any
error** (mypy also runs but is currently non-blocking). Before finishing any Python
change, make sure ruff passes with zero errors. Config lives in `pyproject.toml` under
`[tool.ruff.lint]` (line-length 100; rule sets `E,W,F,I,B,C4,UP`; `E501`/`B008` ignored).
Concretely, write code that already satisfies these:
- **Modern typing (UP):** use built-in generics and unions — `list[int]`, `dict[str, X]`,
  `X | None` — NOT `typing.List`/`Dict`/`Optional`/`Union`. Don't import those from `typing`.
- **Sorted imports (I001):** stdlib → third-party → first-party, each group alphabetized.
- **Exception chaining (B904):** inside an `except`, always chain — `raise HTTPException(...)
  from err` when the caught exception is meaningful, or `... from None` for a deliberate
  translation (e.g. converting a lookup miss to a 404). Never a bare `raise X(...)` in `except`.
- **No trailing/blank-line whitespace (W29x)**, files end with a newline, no unused imports (F401).
- If a rule genuinely shouldn't apply, add a scoped `# noqa: <CODE>` with a reason — don't
  broaden the global ignore list without asking.
- No local Python here (the `.venv` is a broken shim). Use the Docker-backed make
  targets: `make lint` / `.\make.ps1 lint` (check) and `make lint-fix` /
  `.\make.ps1 lint-fix` (auto-fix imports/typing/whitespace; B904 must be fixed by hand).
- A pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs ruff in Docker and blocks commits with
  lint errors. Enable it once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (needs
  Docker running; bypass in emergencies with `git commit --no-verify`).

## What this service owns
- Postgres tables: `sites`, `devices`, `device_points`, `device_points_readings`,
  `schema_migrations`. Migrations were squashed on 2026-09-22 into a 4-file baseline
  (`001`–`004`, one per table); the old `device_register_map`, `*_configs`,
  `register_readings_raw` and `register_readings_translated` tables no longer exist — don't
  reference them. No `create_hypertable` call exists in any migration, so these are plain
  Postgres tables despite the TimescaleDB image.
- Redis: APScheduler leader-election / job locks, plus a `/api/cache` admin CRUD surface
  (not a message bus). The poll and read paths do NOT use the cache — it is not read-through.
- Publishes no events to any broker; there is no DAS API integration.

## Gotchas
- Host ports are remapped: app 8000, **postgres 5435→5432, redis 6380→6379**. A local
  `.env` for tests/tools must target 5435/6380, not the defaults.
- Migrations are raw numbered SQL in `src/db/migrations/NNN_*.sql`, applied and tracked in
  `schema_migrations` by `scripts/migrate_db.py`. No Alembic — add a new `NNN_*.sql` to change schema.
- Scheduler uses Redis leader election: only ONE replica polls (job `modbus_poll`, every
  `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default 10). It won't start if Redis is down; `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false`
  disables it. Polling targets are read from the DB (sites → devices → device-points).
- A global `validate_time_range` middleware (`src/api/middleware/`) runs on every request
  and rejects bad start/end query params.
- `main.py` hardcodes `reload=True`; the Dockerfile runs a single uvicorn process.
  There is no gunicorn config in this repo.

## Output style (keep token usage down)
- Keep responses short. Lead with the answer; no recap tables or restated diffs unless asked.
- Don't re-print file contents you just edited.
